          Funge Platform represents a sophisticated and dynamic social NFT
          marketplace that offers users a seamless and comprehensive ecosystem
          for the acquisition, sale, and creation of NFTs. Notably, it leverages
          the robust capabilities of the Polygon blockchain to provide an
          optimized experience, characterized by exceptionally low transaction
          fees. This platform serves as a nexus for individuals passionate about
          non-fungible tokens, fostering a thriving community of collectors,
          creators, and enthusiasts. Funge Platform's integration with the
          Polygon blockchain ensures that users can transact with minimal
          overhead costs, making it an attractive choice for those seeking
          cost-effective NFT interactions within the blockchain space

        <p class="text-customGray font-bricolage">
          The first version of the Funge platform was launched on Android at the
          MVP stage as a mere NFT market place for buying and selling of NFTs.
          However there was need to further expand on the scope of the solution
          based on increased user needs which were gathered from research and
          user feedbacks. Other than having just a market place, the client
          wanted to create a more engaging experience between buyers and sellers
          on the platform while keeping the UX simple enough for any level of
          user.

            I conducted a preliminary assessment of the existing user interface
            within the application, focusing on a comprehensive review of
            various visual elements. This evaluation encompassed an examination

            I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the application's

          insights into the early users' experiences with the MVP and gained a
          sense of their initial expectations. The primary research facilitated
          a crucial alignment between the business objectives and user needs.

          To commence this phase of the design, my initial step involved

          This in-depth examination of the pre-existing kits, undertaken with a
          focus on scalability, enabled me to enact a comprehensive

        <p class="text-customGray font-bricolage">
          Working on this project further emphasized the importance of employing
          a data driven approach to design problems. Initially, design decisions
          were influenced by stakeholders biases and there was a huge gap
          between the delivered product and user needs as noticed from the
          research. I balanced this out by introducing a data driven approach.
          Unfortunately, I didn’t see the implementation of this project due to
          budget constraints from the client. I would have loved to conduct
          series of user testing with the community members of all levels.
