          The first version of the Funge platform was launched on Android at the
          MVP stage as a mere NFT market place for buying and selling of NFTs.
          However there was need to further expand on the scope of the solution
          based on increased user needs which were gathered from research and
          user feedbacks. Other than having just a market place, the client
          wanted to create a more engaging experience between buyers and sellers
          on the platform while keeping the UX simple enough for any level of
          user.

            I conducted a preliminary assessment of the existing user interface
            within the application, focusing on a comprehensive review of
            various visual elements. This evaluation encompassed an examination

            I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the application's

            One of my primary focal points was the assessment of accessibility,

            tasked with a comprehensive visual overhaul, I meticulously
            documented any instances where the application fell short of these
            accessibility guidelines.

            As I navigated through the app's user experience, I dedicated myself

          Through the survey, I successfully identified several competitors in
          the Funge NFT Marketplace space. Subsequently, I conducted a succinct
          yet comprehensive competitive analysis, focusing on discerning their
          strengths and pinpointing opportunities for capitalizing on their
          weaknesses. Among the noteworthy competitors that I examined included

          Having direct insights from Funge community members played a pivotal
          role in shaping the bedrock of our primary research efforts. Guided by
          the principles of User-Centered Design, we delved deep into uncovering
          user pain points. Through our primary research, we gained valuable
          insights into the early users' experiences with the MVP and gained a
          sense of their initial expectations. The primary research facilitated
          a crucial alignment between the business objectives and user needs.
          This alignment proved instrumental in our endeavor to prioritize
          feature development, a critical task given our time constraints.

          Having carefully collected essential insights through multiple rounds
          of idea exchange, moodboarding, and sketching, we proceeded to
          construct the user flows for the various use cases and features. To
          ensure clarity and ease of comprehension, I divided these user flows
          into manageable sections, avoiding unnecessary complexity. While I
          cannot present the entirety of the flow diagrams here, I have included

          To commence this phase of the design, my initial step involved
          accessing and conducting a thorough audit of the existing brand kits.
          This in-depth examination of the pre-existing kits, undertaken with a
          focus on scalability, enabled me to enact a comprehensive
          restructuring of the component library . My primary goal was to
          reinstate a high level of design consistency by crafting reusable
          brand components and assets, encompassing elements like typography,
          color palettes, icons, and grid systems, among others

          I collaborated with the Samuel to pull the designs off on figma with
          series of Iterations. We got all the team members to collaborate and
          make necessary contributions while the designs were going on. This was
          one way to get everyone to pull in the same direction.

          Working on this project further emphasized the importance of employing
          a data driven approach to design problems. Initially, design decisions
          were influenced by stakeholders biases and there was a huge gap
          between the delivered product and user needs as noticed from the
          research. I balanced this out by introducing a data driven approach.
          Unfortunately, I didn’t see the implementation of this project due to
          budget constraints from the client. I would have loved to conduct
          series of user testing with the community members of all levels.
